# Week1-CS50-
covering all concepts learnt in week 1 and problem sets 1 

All concept learnt so far were interesting and at first they come off as easy . However when you start implementing them onto the problem sets , you realise certain conditionals are used once you know and understand the pattern of each problem . One take away i have was that the match case ... conditional works with patterns and not askingtrue or false (boolean operation) . For cases where you want to check infact if a condition is true or false do this ... thats for if , elif , else statements , but match case statements it is more of pattern and you want to match something to a specific thing . 
Where i got to learn this even deeper is when i was working with extensions and i realised there are many way sthe code coulve been improves , match case was not one of them .

I got to learn more and have a way better understanding of what the split( ) method is used for it literally splits up a single string and places each as unique data stored in a list . This is one way i guess we get to further practise how to manipulate list data structure. Along the line i got to use endswith( ) method that checks what a string ends with , and startswith( ) method to test out different conditiions . 


Overall week 1 might have taken my time but it deepend my understanding on the various methods  and data structures , and how to manipulate them to create a suitable outcome.
